title: Tree-shaking

---

If you use the ESM builds of the library, this library fully supports tree-shaking,
only the controllers you directly import will be bundled with your application.

When you have code that just imports a single controller:
```js
import { AutoSubmitFormController } from "stimulus-library";
```

As long as your bundler supports it, only that one controller will be bundled into your application code.
You don't have to ship the entire Stimulus-Library just to get the benefit of a single controller.
