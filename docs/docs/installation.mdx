To get started, you'll need to add the `stimulus-library` package to your project.

To do so, either add `stimulus-library` to your package.json manually

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "stimulus-library": "latest"
  }
}
```

or run
`npm install --save stimulus-library` or `yarn add stimulus-library`

Then, to get started import and register the controllers you want to use

```js
import { Application } from "stimulus";
import { AutoSubmitFormController } from "stimulus-library";

const application = Application.start();
application.register("auto-submit-form", AutoSubmitFormController);
```
