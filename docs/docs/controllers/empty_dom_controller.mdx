## Purpose

Mainly for use with TurboStreams or AJAX loaded content that modifies a container interactively. When interactions mutate the DOM and add/remove content, detect when the container you attach the controller to becomes empty/not empty.

You can then style the controller, or show a nice placeholder when the container is empty, rather than showing empty space.

# How to Use

## Simple Case

The controller emits an event `dom:empty` when the container becomes empty, and `dom:not-empty` when it is no longer empty (and for every DOM update that means it is still not empty). Use those events to hook up other Stimulus actions. This particular example toggles the hide/show of a nice status message when the
container is empty.

## Advanced Case

You can scope what the controller watches for inside the container using a CSS selector in the `data-empty-dom-scope-selector-value` attribute.

The selector you specify will be used to `querySelectorAll` the children/subtree of the container you attach the controller too, and fire the
`dom:empty` and `dom:not-empty` events when the results of the query are empty/not empty.
